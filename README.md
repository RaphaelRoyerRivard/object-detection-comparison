# faster-rcnn-test

For `faster_rcnn_test.py` and `dense_optical_flow.py` to work, your directory tree should look like that :

	- Some folder
		- object-detection-comparison
		- images
			- dataset1 (can be named however you like)
			- dataset2
			- etc.

To choose to either visualize or save the results of both methods, change the values of the `save` and `show` parameters at the end of the `faster_rcnn_test.py` and `dense_optical_flow.py` files.

Result files in `Analyse` have the following information :

- Precision
- Recall
